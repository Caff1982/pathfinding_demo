## Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization using Pygame

The purpose of this project is to show the difference between different pathfinding algorithms. I wanted to develop this to improve my understanding of pathfinding/graph-theory.

### Instructions
* Use the mouse to click and create/remove walls
* Use the mouse to move the start and end squares
* The app uses 8 way movement as default, to alternate between 4/8 way movement use 4 or 8 using the keyboard
* Use the numbers-pad to select which algorithm you want to visualize:
⋅⋅0. Breadth-First Search
⋅⋅1. Depth-First Search
⋅⋅2. Dijkstra
⋅⋅3. A-Star
* Press spacebar to clear the solution and start again
