## Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization using Pygame

The purpose of this project is to show the difference between different pathfinding algorithms. I wanted to develop this to improve my understanding of pathfinding/graph-theory and the algorithms used.

### Instructions
* Use the mouse to click and create/remove walls
* The app uses 4 way movement(up, down, left, right) as default, to select 8 way
movement press 8, press4 againg to go back to 4 way movement
* To select an algorithm press 'b' for BFS, 'd' for dijkstra or 'a' for a start
* Press space bar to start the search, use 'p' to pause
